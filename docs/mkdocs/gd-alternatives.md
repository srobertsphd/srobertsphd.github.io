Yes â€” here are some **alternatives to Google Docs** that meet most of your goals (ubiquity, ease of use, collaborative editing, and structured export), and that may even integrate more smoothly depending on the tooling and workflows you prefer:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Microsoft Word Online (Office 365)**

* **Why it might work:** Ubiquitous in enterprise and education. Like Google Docs, allows real-time collaboration. Can export as PDF, DOCX, or even HTML. Can be accessed via Microsoft Graph API.
* **Export/Integration:** Automatable via **Microsoft Graph API**, including conversion to PDF.
* **Pros:** Familiar UI. Good layout fidelity. Strong enterprise support.
* **Cons:** Requires Microsoft account (not everyone has it). Slightly heavier interface. API is more complex to set up than Googleâ€™s.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Notion**

* **Why it might work:** Gaining wide adoption in teams. Easy to use. Collaborative. Can export pages to Markdown or PDF.
* **Export/Integration:** Can be scripted with Notion API to pull Markdown or HTML. PDFs require headless browser automation.
* **Pros:** Clean formatting, good for structured docs. Markdown export is decent.
* **Cons:** Markdown export may require cleanup. PDF export not available via API (yet). Not everyone uses it by default.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Dropbox Paper**

* **Why it might work:** Very simple collaborative editor. Exports to Markdown. Works well for lightweight docs.
* **Export/Integration:** Markdown export is available. PDF via print-to-PDF (not easily scriptable).
* **Pros:** Cleaner Markdown than Google Docs. Minimalist UI. Easy sharing.
* **Cons:** Less widely used than Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Automation is limited.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **HackMD / CodiMD**

* **Why it might work:** Real-time collaborative Markdown editor. Works in the browser. Ideal if your team is willing to use Markdown directly.
* **Export/Integration:** Native Markdown format. Easy to save/export via Git integration.
* **Pros:** Native to Markdown. Versioning, GitHub integration. Open-source options.
* **Cons:** Requires Markdown fluency. Not as broadly known as Google Docs. More tech-friendly than general-friendly.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Etherpad**

* **Why it might work:** Lightweight collaborative plain-text/Markdown editor. Open source. Can self-host or use public pads.
* **Export/Integration:** Text export (Markdown if you enforce it). API available.
* **Pros:** Extremely lightweight. Zero login. Great for open collaboration.
* **Cons:** Primitive formatting. Poor for images/tables. Not widely adopted beyond tech/hackathon circles.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Confluence (Atlassian)**

* **Why it might work:** Used by many orgs for internal docs. Structured content. Exportable to PDF/Word.
* **Export/Integration:** Has REST API. PDF export can be automated with plugins or headless browsers.
* **Pros:** Powerful. Familiar to enterprise teams. Organizes pages well.
* **Cons:** Not everyone has access. Not free. Heavier weight. Steeper learning curve.

---

### âœ… Final Opinion

**Google Docs is probably still the best overall fit** for your needs:

* Almost everyone already uses it.
* It handles images/tables well.
* It can export clean PDFs or Markdown.
* The API is scriptable.
* The versioning (named versions) adds value.

The **closest viable alternatives** are:

* **Microsoft Word Online** (if your user base leans Microsoft).
* **HackMD** (if your users are developers or markdown-fluent).

If you're open to lighter alternatives or your users are more technical, a **Markdown-first tool like HackMD** could simplify your entire pipeline and skip conversion entirely. But if you want to support *anyone*, **Google Docs is still king** for a write-anywhere â†’ publish-anywhere model.
